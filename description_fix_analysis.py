üîß FRAME DESCRIPTION PERSISTENCE FIX

The issue: Timeline loading overwrites canvas frame descriptions with stale data.

Root cause: In load_template_editor_settings, the sequence is:
1. Canvas loads with correct descriptions  
2. Timeline loads and overwrites with old descriptions
3. User edits are lost on restart

Solution: After loading, sync timeline descriptions with canvas descriptions.
