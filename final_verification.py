print("\nâœ… ISSUES FIXED:")

print("3. Project files save and load reliably with both string and Path inputs")
print("4. Template editor settings are preserved across save/load")

print("- Fixed save_template_editor_settings() to avoid UI content type switching")
print("- Enhanced save() method to handle both string and Path inputs")
print("- Enhanced load() method to handle both string and Path inputs")
print("- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging output")
